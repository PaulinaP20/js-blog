                      <p>To start running you should make sure you have a good pair of running shoes to support your feet. Begin with a light warm-up, like stretching or brisk walking, for about 5-10 minutues to get your muscles ready. When you start running, go at a comfortable pace, gradually inreacing the time or distance over time.</p>

                      <p>Focus on your form by keeping your posture upright and your strides relaxed. It's imporatnt to run consistently, airming for 2 or 3 time a week, and gradually increase your intensity. The first time I propose go run for 20-30 minutes. It's best not to push yourself too hard. YOU DONT BE TIRED AFTER RUN (you will quickly become discourange). The key is consistency and making it enjoyable, rather than exhausting yourself at the beginning.</p>

                      <p>After each run, cool down by walking and stretching to help your muscles recover. Starting slow and staying consistent will help you build endurance and avoid injury.</p>

                      Is it possible to run a marathon after only 16 weeks of training?</h3>
                    <p class="post-author" ></p>
                    <div class="post-content">
                      <p>The aswear is...Yes. It is possible to run a marathon after 16 weeks of training, especcially if you're starting from a solid base of fitness. However, it depends on your current fitness level, running experience and how consistently you follor the training plan. For a beginner, a 16-week allows enought time to build endurance and strenght gradually. </p>

                      <p>Key points to consider:
                        <ul>
                          <li>Current fitness level</li>
                          <li>Training consisntecy</li>
                          <li>Recovery and rest</li>
                          <li>Nutrition and hydration</li>
                          <li>Mental toughness (more in the next articles)</li>
                        </ul>

                      </p>

                      <p>During the 16 -week training period, you will progresively increase your long run distance. The longest run will typically peak around 20 miles in the weekds before the race. While this isn't the full marathon distance, it gives your bodt yhe endurance needed to handle race day, when the adrenaline and atmosphere will help us push you through the final miles. </p>

                      <p>On the day of the race, it's imporatnt to have a light breakfast 2-3 hours before the race. As you run, your body will burn thought its glycogen store. This is why it's crusial to keep refueling during the race. Hydrate regularly, especially at air stations and consider drinking an electrolyte beverage to replace the salts lost in sweat (energy gels or chews)</p>

                        <li>Warmp up and cool down - always start with dynamic stretches to warp up and finish static streches to cool down.</li>
                        <li>Gradual increase - increase your mileage and intensity slowly, following the '10% rule' ( dont increase by more than 10% each week)</li>
                        <li> Proper footwear - wear well-fitted shoes designes for you foot type and replace them every 200-500 miles.</li>

                    <div class="post-content">
                      <p>It's imporant to consider your foot type, running style and proper fit. First, identify your foot type - if your foot rolls inward too much (overpronation) you'll need stability or motion control shoes. It it rolls too little (underpronation or supination) you'll want shoes with extra cushioning. For neutral feet, a neutral shoes work well.</p>

                      <p>Second, think about where you'll be running. If you're mostly on pavement, opt for road shoes that provide cushioning and support. For trail running, look for shoes with a more durable, rugged tread designed to handle off-road terrain.</p>

                      <p>Testing shoes by running in them and considering comfort is key - good shoes should feel like an extension your body, supporting you without cousing discomfort.</p>

                      <p>Strenght training is key for runners to improve performance, prevent injuries and build endurance. Focusing on the core helps with stability and posture, while strengthening legs and glutes improves running power and reduces joint stress.</p>

                      <p>Exercise like squats, lunges and planks target these areas, while upper body exercise like push-ups and rows anhance posture and arm swing.</p>

                      <p>Aim for 2-3 strength training sessions per week, ideally on non-running days of after short runs. By including strength training, you'll enhance your running efficiency and reduce risk of injury.</p>

                      <p>In my opinion mental is the most important thing in running. 60% of your success is in mind and 40% in your body.</p>

                      <p>Set a clear goal, whether it's finishing, echieving a personal best or just enjoying the expercience. Break the race into smaller segment to avoid feeling overwhelmed. Visualize crossing the finish line and feeling strong. During your training, practice when you're tired or in less-than-ideal conditions. This will help you get used to pushing throught mental barriers on race day. Stay positive and have strategy for this bad moments like repeating a motivating mantra or focusing on your breathing.</p>

                      <p>On race day, expect difficult moments and prepare for them. Have a plan for staying focused and managing discomfort, whetever it's throught pacing, hydration or mental distractions. Trust yourself and remember that the mental chellenge is just a part of the marathon experience.</p>

                      <p>Running in any weather can be challenging but with the right approach, it can also be rewarding.</p>

                      <ul>
                        <li>Hot weather: Stay hydrated, wear lightweight, moisture-wicking clothes and run during cooler parts of the day, like early morning or evening. Use sunscreen and take breaks if needed to prevent overheating.</li>
                        <li>Cold weather: dress in layers to stay warm with moisture-wicking base layer and an insulating layer on top. Avoid cotton, as it raps sweat. Be mindful of frostbite risk and protect extremities (hands, feet, ears). </li>
                        <li>Rainy weather: Wear a lightweight, waterproff jacket to stay dry and  Embrace the rain as a fun challenge - you don't know what the weather will be like on day of the marathon.</li>
                        <li>Windy weather: wear a windproff jacket and face the wind head-on on the first half of your run so you'll have a tailwind on the way back. Adjust your pace as needed to handle resistance.</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>Running in any weather requires smart preparation, so you can enjouy your runs safely, no matter the conditions.</p>

                      <p>After a long run, recovery is crucial to heelp your body repair and avoid injuries. Start by hydrating to replace the fluids you lost during your run. Drinking water is key to restoring your hydration levels.</p>

                    <div class="post-content">
                      <p>Here are some common running myths:</p>

                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          Running every dat is necessary: Rest is essential for recovery. Overtraining can lead to burnout and injury, so include rest days or cross-training.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Running is bad for knees: Moderate running with proper form strengthens knee muscles and helps prevent joint issues.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          You need to stretch before runnning: Static stretching before a run can descrease performance and increase injury risk. Use dynamic streches before and static after.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Card loading before every run: Only long-distance runners need to focus on carb-loading. For shorter runs, a balanced meal beforehand is sufficient.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          You need to run fast: Slower, consistent runs are just as effective for building endurance, improving health and preventing injuries "to run fast, you have to run slow".
                        </li>
                      </ul>
